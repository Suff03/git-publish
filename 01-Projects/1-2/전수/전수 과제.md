**1.3** A certain polymer is used for evacuation systems for aircraft. It is important that the polymer be resistant to the aging process. Twenty specimens of the polymer were used in an experiment. Ten were assigned randomly to be exposed to an accelerated batch aging process that involved exposure to high temperatures for 10 days. Measurements of tensile strength of the specimens were made, and the following data were recorded on tensile strength in psi:

(c) Calculate the sample mean tensile strength of the two samples.

**Sol)** sample mean(표본 평균)을 계산하라는 문제이다.
$$mean(\text{No aging}) = 222.1$$
$$mean(\text{Aging})=209.9$$

(d) Calculate the median for both. Discuss the similarity or lack of similarity between the mean and median of each group.

**Sol)** sample size가 even이므로,
$$med(x) = \frac{x_{\frac{n}{2}} + x_{\frac{n}{2}+1}}{2} \text{if $n$ is even}
$$

So, 정렬을 한 후
$$med(\text{No aging})=\frac{x_5+x_6}{2}=221.5$$
$$med(\text{Aging})=\frac{x_5+x_6}{2}=210$$

**1.4** In a study conducted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech, the steel rods supplied by two different companies were compared. Ten sample springs were made out of the steel rods supplied by each company, and a measure of flexibility was recorded for each. The data are as follows:

![[Pasted image 20230920195439.png]]

(a) Calculate the sample mean and median for the data for the two companies.

**Sol)**
$$mean(\text{Company A}) = 7.95$$
$$mean(\text{Company B}) = 10.26$$
$$med(\text{Company A})=\frac{x_5+x_6}{2}=8.25$$
$$med(\text{Company B})=\frac{x_5+x_6}{2}=10.15$$

**2.78** A manufacturer of a flu vaccine is concerned about the quality of its flu serum. Batches of serum are processed by three different departments having rejection rates of 0.10, 0.08, and 0.12, respectively. The inspections by the three departments are *sequential and independent*.

(a) What is the probability that a batch of serum survives the first departmental inspection but is rejected by the second department?

**Sol)** 연속적이고 독립이라는 문구를 주의 깊게 봐야 한다.
첫 부서의 검사를 통과하고, 다음 검사에서 거절 당할 probability는
$$P({R_{1}'\cap}R_2)=(1-0.10)(0.08)=(0.9)(0.08)=0.072$$

(b) What is the probability that a batch of serum is rejected by the third department?

**Sol)** 마찬가지로,
$$P({R_{1}'\cap}R_{2}'\cap R_3)=(0.9)(0.92)(0.12)=0.09936$$

**2.80** The probability that an automobile being filled with gasoline also needs an oil change is 0.25; the probability that it needs a new oil filter is 0.40; and the probability that both the oil and the filter need changing is 0.14.

a) If the oil has to be changed, what is the probability that a new oil filter is needed?

**Sol)** 문제 해석 : $P(C)=0.25, P(F)=0.4, P(C\cap F)=0.14$
오일을 교체해야 할 경우, 새로운 오일 필터가 필요할 확률은?

조건부 확률로 해결한다.
$$P(F\mid C) = \frac{P(C\cap F)}{P(C)}=\frac{0.14}{0.25}=0.56$$

(b) If a new oil filter is needed, what is the probability that the oil has to be changed?

**Sol)** 만약 새 오일 필터가 필요하다면, 오일을 교체해야 할 확률은?
$$P(C\mid F) = \frac{P(C\cap F)}{P(F)}=\frac{0.14}{0.4}=0.35$$

**2.88** Before the distribution of certain statistical software, *every fourth compact disk (CD) is tested for accuracy*. The testing process consists of running four *independent* programs and checking the results. The failure rates for the four testing programs are, respectively, 0.01, 0.03, 0.02, and 0.01.

(a) What is the probability that a CD was tested <u>and</u> failed any test?

**Sol)** 네 번째 디스크 마다 검사를 진행한다. CD가 검사 되고 테스트에 실패했을 확률은?

먼저 테스트에 한 번이라도 실패했을 확률을 구한다. (테스트에 떨어질 확률)
이는 전체 - 테스트에 모두 통과했을 확률과 같다. 테스트들은 모두 독립이므로,
$$P(D)=1-(0.09)(0.07)(0.08)(0.09)=0.068$$

따라서 테스트에 한 번이라도 실패했을 확률은 $0.068$이다.

CD가 검사 되고, (And) 테스트에 실패했을 확률은 (두 사건은 서로 독립이다.)
$$P(D\cap T)=P(D)P(T)=(0.068)(0.25)=0.017$$

(b) Given that a CD was tested, what is the probability that it failed program 2 or 3?

**Sol)** CD가 테스트 되었을 때, 두 번째나 세 번째 테스트에서 실패했을 확률은? (나머지 테스트에는 성공)

==이게 왜 조건부 확률이 아니지?==
$$P({F_{2}\cup}F_3)=(1-P({F_{2}'}\cap {F_3}'))$$

(c) In a sample of 100, how many CDs would you expect to be rejected?

**Sol)** 100장 중, 예측 상 테스트에 실패할 CD의 수는?
100장 X 테스트에 떨어질 확률
$$100\times P(D)=100\times(0.068)=6.8$$

(d) Given that a CD was defective, what is the probability that it was tested?

**Sol)** CD가 오염 되었을 때, 테스트 되었을 확률은?
테스트 했을 확률과 $P(T)$와 오염되었을 확률 $P(D)$는 서로 독립이다.
$$P(T\mid D)=\frac{P(T\cap D)}{P(D)}=\frac{P(T)P(D)}{P(D)}=P(T)=0.25$$

**2.93** A circuit system is given in Figure 2.11. Assume the components fail independently.

(a) What is the probability that the entire system works?
$$
\begin{align*}
P((A\cap B)\cup(C\cap D\cap E))&=P(A)P(B)+P(C)P(D)P(E)-P(A)P(B)P(C)P(D)P(E)
\\&=(0.7)(0.7)+(0.8)(0.8)(0.8)-(0.7)(0.7)(0.7)(0.8)(0.8)\\
\\&=0.751\end{align*}
$$
(b) Given that the system works, what is the probability that the component A is not working?
$$\begin{align*}
P(A'\mid S)&=\frac{P(A'\cap S)}{P(S)}=\frac{P(A')P(S\mid A')}{P(S)}
=\frac{P(A')P(C)P(D)P(E)}{P(S)}\\&=\frac{(0.3)(0.8)(0.8)(0.8)}{0.751}\\\\
&=0.205
\end{align*}$$

**2.94** In the situation of Exercise 2.93, it is known that the system does not work. What is the probability that the component A also does not work?

**Sol)** 시스템이 작동하지 않을 때 A 또한 작동하지 않을 확률 (조건부 확률)
$$\begin{align*}
P(A'\mid S')&=\frac{P(A'\cap S')}{P(S')}
=\frac{P(A')P(S'\mid A')}{1-P(S)}\\&=\frac{P(A')(1-P(C\cap D\cap E))}{1-P(S)}\\&=\frac{(0.3)(1-(0.8)^3)}{1-0.751}\\
&=0.588
\end{align*}$$

**2.96** Police plan to enforce speed limits by using radar traps at four different locations within the city limits. The radar traps at each of the locations L1, L2, L3, and L4 will be operated 40%, 30%, 20%, and 30% of the time. If a person who is speeding on her way to work has probabilities of 0.2, 0.1, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively, of passing through these locations, <u>what is the probability that she will receive a speeding ticket?</u>

**Sol)** 구하는 것 : 어떤 사람이 속도 위반 딱지를 받을 확률! $P(T)$
$$\begin{align*}
P(T)&=P(L_1)P(T\mid L_1)+P(L_2)P(T\mid L_2)+P(L_3)P(T\mid L_3)+P(L_4)P(T\mid L_4)\\
&=(0.4)(0.2)+(0.3)(0.1)+(0.2)(0.5)+(0.3)(0.2)\\

**2.102** Denote by A, B, and C the events that a grand prize is behind doors A, B, and C, respectively. Suppose you randomly picked a door, say A. The game host opened a door, say B, and showed there was no prize behind it. Now the host offers you the option of either staying at the door that you picked (A) or switching to the remaining unopened door (C). Use probability to explain whether you should switch or not.

**Sol)** 참가자는 A를 선택했고 B 뒤에는 아무것도 없었다.

$P(X),\   X=A,B,C$ : 상금이 $X$번째 문에 있을 확률이다. 이는 모두 $\frac{1}{3}$
$P(D)$ : 참가자가 $A$를 선택 했을 때 다른 문을 열 확률이다.

$P(X\mid D)$ : $A$를 선택 했을 때 상금이 없는 다른 한 문을 연 후에 정답이 $X$일 확률.
$P(D\mid X)$ : $X$가 정답이고 참가자가 $A$를 선택 했을 때 $B$ 문을 열 확률

따라서,
$P(D\mid A)=\frac{1}{2}$ : $A$를 제외하고 $B$와 $C$가 남음
$P(D\mid B)=0$ : $B$문을 열 수는 없으므로..
$P(D\mid C)=1$ : $A$를 제외하고 $B$만 남음

결과를 유지한다면, ($A$를 선택)
$$
\begin{align*}
P(A\mid D)&= \frac{P(A)P(D\mid A)}{P(A)P(D\mid A)+P(B)P(D\mid B)+P(C)P(D\mid C)}\\&=\frac{\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\times0+\frac{1}{3}\times1}\\
\\&=\frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

유지하지 않는다면, ($C$를 선택)
$$
\begin{align*}
P(C\mid D)&= \frac{P(C)P(D\mid C)}{P(A)P(D\mid A)+P(B)P(D\mid B)+P(C)P(D\mid C)}\\&=\frac{\frac{1}{3}\times1}{\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}\times0+\frac{1}{3}\times1}\\
\\&=\frac{2}{3}
\end{align*}
$$

따라서 문을 바꾸는 것이 유리한 선택이다.
